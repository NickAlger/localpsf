\section*{Reply to the Reviewer 2:}

Thanks for the careful reading and for your helpful comments and
suggestions.  Please find below point-by-point replies (in black) to
your comments and questions (which are reprinted in blue). To give you
an overview of all the changes in the paper, we also provide a
diff-document that highlights the changes between the initial
submission and this re-submission.\\[1ex]

\referee{I have read the paper with pleasure and have the following
  suggestions for improvement:\\}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \referee{Interesting work, generally well-written. Perhaps a
  small illustrative example with a few figures at the beginning could
  help understand the procedure intuitively.}

  \noindent{To do.}

\item \referee{possibly interesting references for estimating Hessians
  in linearised seismic imaging include:
  \url{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acha.2007.06.007},
  \url{https://doi.org/10.1190/1.2836323}}

  \noindent{Noemi will give it a try.}

\item \referee{How about comparison with other methods, like those
  proposed in [7],[52]? and you say a bit more? it is hard to conclude
  that your method will always outperform these methods.}

    \noindent{For ref 7: Ask Tucker if we could do HODL on the Hessian
      coming from ice mountain problem and record the number of
      mat-vecs needed to achieve a certain accuracy, something like
      Figure 8 in teh HODLR paper. Nick will do some estimates to
      compare things with ref 52.}

\item \referee{Perhaps it is illustrative to include some 1D blurring
  examples to illustrate robustness of method to departure from
  assumptions (positivity, locality) e.g. on 'indefinite' kernels or
  kernels with multiple modes.}

  \noindent{Use a 2D-deblurring problem and cook up a Hessian with
    entries given by be some modified Gaussian and show that the error
    increases as more negative entires are present in the kernel.}

 \item \referee{is code for applying the developed methods on other
   inverse problems available?}

  \noindent{Ideally we would like to release the code, however this
    will take time. In the meantime, we will make the code available
    upon request.}
