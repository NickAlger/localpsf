Referee #2 (Remarks to the Author):

I have read the paper with pleasure and have the following suggestions for improvement:

- Interesting work, generally well-written. Perhaps a small illustrative example with a few figures at the beginning could help understand the procedure intuitively
- possibly interesting references for estimating Hessians in linearised seismic imaging include: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acha.2007.06.007, https://doi.org/10.1190/1.2836323
- How about comparison with other methods, like those proposed in [7],[52]? and you say a bit more? it is hard to conclude that your method will always outperform these methods.
- Perhaps it is illustrative to include some 1D blurring examples to illustrate robustness of method to departure from assumptions (positivity, locality) e.g. on 'indefinite' kernels or kernels with multiple modes.
- is code for applying the developed methods on other inverse problems available?
